# Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing crowdfunding campaign data using Microsoft Excel. The analysis focuses on uncovering market trends, evaluating campaign success, and performing statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. The dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC and is intended for educational purposes.

## Files Included

- `CrowdfundingBook.xlsm`: The Excel workbook containing all analyses, pivot tables, charts, and summary statistics.

- `Crowdfunding Written Analysis.docx`: An analysis on the insights derived from the workbook including limitations and future suggestions.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Conditional Formatting:**
   - Applied conditional formatting to the `outcome` column to color-code the campaigns based on their status (successful, failed, canceled, or live).
   - Created a `Percent Funded` column to calculate the amount of money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal, and used a three-color scale for visual representation.
   - Added an `Average Donation` column to compute the average amount donated per backer.
   - Created `Parent Category` and `Sub-Category` columns to split the `Category` and `Sub-Category` columns into two separate columns.

2. **Pivot Tables and Charts:**
   - Created a pivot table to analyze campaign outcomes per category, with a stacked-column pivot chart filtered by country.
   - Developed another pivot table to count campaign outcomes per sub-category, with a corresponding stacked-column pivot chart filtered by country and parent category.
   - Converted Unix timestamps in `deadline` and `launched_at` columns to Excel's date format, and used these in a pivot table to analyze outcomes by creation date.
   - Created a pivot-chart line graph to visualize the new table.

3. **Crowdfunding Goal Analysis:**
   - Added a new sheet with columns for goal ranges, and used `COUNTIFS()` to count successful, failed, and canceled projects within these ranges.
   - Calculated the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.
   - Created a line chart to graph the relationship between goal amount and chances of success, failure, or cancellation.

4. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Created summary statistics for the number of backers in successful and unsuccessful campaigns, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation.
   - Evaluated whether the mean or median better summarizes the data and assessed variability in successful vs. unsuccessful campaigns.
